# Software Defined Networking in a Campus Environment

SOFTWARE DEFINED NETWORKING

Software-defined networking (SDN) is a new emerging technology for networking in which control is Decoupled a hardware and given to software part called a controller[1]. When a packet arrives at a switch in a foreseeable network rule built into the switch patented firmware tell the switch where to forward the packet. The switch sends every packet going to the same destination along the same path and treats all the packets the exact same way. In the campus network, smart switches designed with application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are Refined enough to recognize different types of packets and treat them differently, but such switches can be quite expensive.

This project implements SDN in a campus setting. A central intelligent controller is implemented using Python. I have implemnted bandwidth management, firewall and routing policies . The infrastructure was visualized and tested using wireshark and mininet.
